## Concepts

- `Source`
    - this is a syncronous component
    - provides a feed of values via a `next` method
        - typically to a `Publisher`
    - the feed is over when `undef` is returned
        - FIXME: This should be an `Option` type
    - this is not owned by the system
- `Sink`
    - this is a syncronous component
    - this captures a feed of values via `drip` method
        - typically from a `Subscriber`
    - these values can be accessed via a `drain` method
    - this is not owned by the system


- `Publisher`
    - this is a asyncronous component
    - given a `Source` publish values via a `Subscription` to a `Subscriber`
    - will passively wait until need is signalled
    - this is not owned by the system
- `Subscriber`
    - this is a asyncronous component
    - given a `Subscription` can request values from a `Publisher` and pass them onto a `Sink`
    - this must signal for need to accommodate back-pressure
    - this is not owned by the system
- `Subscription`
    - this is a asyncronous component
    - given a `Subscriber` and `Publisher` can handle manage the flow via an `Observer`
    - this is the engine of this system, it drives the flow
    - this is owned by the `Publisher` for each time `*Subscribe` is called
- `Observer`
    - this is a asyncronous component
    - This serves as a bridge between a `Publisher` and `Subscriber`
    - it watches for a specific amount of requests from a `Publisher`
        - and forwards to a `Subscriber`
        - an event is sent to the `Subscriber` when all requests have been seen
    - this is owned by the `Subscription` for each time `*Request` is called

## ARRAGEMENT

In the syncronous world, we have the following:

- `Source` which has been connected to a `Publisher`
- `Sink` which has been connected to a `Subscriber`

In the asyncronous world, we have the following:

- `Publishers` manages a set of `Subscription` objects
    - one for each `Subscriber` passed with a `*Subscribe` event
    - they are destroyed when an `*Unsubscribe` event received
    - `Subscriptions` have a 1-to-1 relation with `Subscriber`

- `Subscriptions` creates an `Observer` for each `*Request` sent
    - `Observer` has a `Subscriber` to whom it it forwards events.
    - after a `*Request` has completed, the `Observer` is destroyed


```

## Phase 1 - CONNECT
<!-------------------------------------------------------->

### Step 1.

- `Publisher`
    - is connected to a `Source`
- `Subscriber`
    - is connected to a `Sink`

> NOTE:
> This step is mostly syncronous, as `Source` & `Sink` are sync components
> but there is nothing stopping you from doing it asyncronously via events
> if you wanted.

### Step 2.

- `Subscriber`
    - subscribes to a `Publisher` by sending a `*Subscribe` event

### Step 3.

- `Publisher`
    - receieves the `*Subscribe` events from `Subscriber`
        - spawns a new `Subscription`
        - sends `*OnSubscribe` to `Subscriber` with newly spawned `Subscription`

### End Status

At this point the `Publisher` and `Subscriber` are both connected via the
`Subscription` all that is left is for the `Subscriber` to signal a need
for values.

```

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
## Phase 2 - RUN
<!-------------------------------------------------------->

### Step 1.

- `Subscriber`
    - sends `*Request` event to `*Subscription` signifying need

> NOTE:
> This will often happen when the `Publisher` sends the `*OnSubscribe`
> event to the `Subscriber`, but it may not, so we use it as a dividing
> line between the phases.

### Step 2.

- `Subscription`
    - receives the `*Request` event
        - spawns a new `Observer` that is connected the `Subscriber`
            - the observer watches for a specific number of requests
        - sends the requested amount of `*GetNext` events to the `Publisher`
            - with the `Observer` as the return address

### Step 3.

- `Publisher`
    - receives the `*GetNext` events
        - requests the `next` value from the `Source`
            - responds to return address (the `Observer`) with:
                - `*OnNext` if it has a value
                - `*OnComplete` if it has no more values
                - `*OnError` if it has an error

### Step 4.

- `Observer`
    - receives the `*OnNext`, `*OnComplete` & `*OnError` events response from `Publisher`
        - forwards event to `Subscriber`
        - if `Observer` has seen all requests it sends `*OnRequestComplete` to `Subscriber`

### Step 5.

- `Subscriber`
    - receives the `*OnNext`, `*OnComplete` & `*OnError` events response from `Observer`
        - `drip` values into the `Sink`

### End Status

This represents on request cycle for a `Subscriber`, where `$n` values can be requested
from the `Publisher` which are then subsequently delivered to the `Observer`. When all
values are delivered to the `Observer` it will signal the `Subscriber` accordingly. At
this point the `Subscriber` must choose if it wants to singal for more need.

Legend:

```

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
## Phase 3 - COMPLETE
<!-------------------------------------------------------->

### Step 1.

- `Publisher`
    - sends an `*OnComplete` to the `Observer`

### Step 2.

- `Observer`
    - trips a circuit breaker in `Observer` and does not forward to the `Subscriber` yet
    - once the `Observer` has seen all request, it forwards the `*OnComplete` to the `Subscriber`


### Step 3.

- `Subscriber`
    - receievs the `*OnComplete` event
        - sends syncronous `done` call to `Sink` to let it know its done
        - sends `*Cancel` to `Subscription`

### Step 4.

- `Subscription`
    - receives the `*Cancel` event from the `Subscriber`
        - sends `*Unsubscribe` event to the `Publisher` with itself as the payload

### Step 5.

- `Publisher`
    - receives the `*Unsubscribe` event from the `Subscription`
        - sends `*OnUnsubscribe` event to `Subscription`

### Step 6.

- `Subscription`
    - receives the `*Unsubscribe` event from the `Publisher`
        - sends `*OnUnsubscribe` signal to `Subscriber`
        - sends `*SIGEXIT` to `Observer`
        - exits()

### Notes

During this flow, several assumptions can be made:

1. The `Subscriber` will only be sent `*OnComplete` once, the `Observer` will buffer them.
2. This means there are no more in-flight requests to `Observer` and therefore nothing to stop.

### End Status

At this point the system has shutdown, all except the `Publisher` and `Subscriber`
both of which are not owned by this flow.
